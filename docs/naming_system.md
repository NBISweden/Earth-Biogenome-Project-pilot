# Naming System

In this document we will plan a common naming scheme between each step in the workflow to ensure interoperability.

## Genome
Identify internal or external origin of the genome assembly, assembly version, path location.

## Sequencing Data
Tag reads as shotgun or targeted sequencing, paired or single end reads, RNAseq, Illumina, PacBio, etc.

## Internal Document Structure
So we have a standard way to store data.
