# About the AGATE Workflow

## Overview
The **Automated Genome Assembly Toolkit and Evaluator (AGATE)** - formerly known as the Earth Biogenome Project Pilot Workflow -
is a comprehensive bioinformatics pipeline developed by the **National Bioinformatics Infrastructure Sweden (NBIS)**. It serves as
the primary genome assembly workflow for SciLifeLab's contribution to the global **Earth BioGenome Project (EBP)**.

This workflow streamlines the complex process of *de novo* genome assembly, taking raw sequencing data and transforming it into
high-quality, curated reference genomes. Built using **Nextflow**, it ensures portability, reproducibility, and scalability across
different computing environments, from local machines to high-performance computing (HPC) clusters like UPPMAX and Dardel.

## The Mission
This workflow contributes to the ambitious goal of the [Earth BioGenome Project](https://www.earthbiogenome.org/): to sequence, catalog,
and characterize the genomes of all of Earth's eukaryotic biodiversity. By providing a standardized, efficient, and robust assembly
pipeline, this software enables researchers to:

* Produce high-quality reference genomes for diverse species.
* Ensure data consistency and adherence to EBP standards.
* Facilitate the study of biodiversity, evolution, and conservation genomics.

## How It Works
The workflow is an automated pipeline that integrates best-in-class bioinformatics tools to handle every stage of the assembly process,
from raw data inspection to final curation.

### Key Pipeline Stages
1.  **Data Inspection**: Validates input data integrity for PacBio HiFi and Hi-C reads.
2.  **Preprocessing**: Prepares reads for assembly, including k-mer analysis and quality control.
3.  **Assembly**: Constructs the primary genome assembly using state-of-the-art assemblers like **HiFiasm**.
4.  **Validation**: Rigorously evaluates assembly quality using tools like **BUSCO** (gene completeness), **Merqury** (k-mer based evaluation), and **Quast**.
5.  **Contamination Screening**: Detects and removes contaminants (e.g., bacteria, adapters) using tools like **FCS-GX**.
6.  **Curation & Polishing**: Refines the assembly through duplicate purging and scaffolding.
7.  **Mitochondrial Assembly**: Specifically targets and assembles the mitochondrial genome using **MitoHiFi** and **OATK**.

## Deployment
The pipeline is designed for flexibility and can be deployed on various infrastructures:

* **HPC Clusters**: Pre-configured profiles for Swedish clusters **UPPMAX** and **Dardel**.
* **Containers**: Full support for **Docker** and **Singularity** to manage software dependencies.
