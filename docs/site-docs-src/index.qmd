> **A scalable, automated Nextflow pipeline for reference-quality genome assembly.**

This is the official documentation for the **AGATE workflow**, a workflow designed to transform raw long-read sequencing data into curated, high-quality reference genomes in compliance with EBP standards.

## Pipeline Overview

The workflow automates the assembly from raw reads to a polished assembly. It handles input validation, assembly, contamination removal, and quality control.

    Input[("📂 Raw Data<br/>(PacBio HiFi, ONT, Hi-C)")] --> QC[("🔍 QC & Inspection<br/>(FastK, GenomeScope)")]
    QC --> Assembly[("⚙️ Assembly<br/>(HiFiasm)")]
    Assembly --> Decon[("🦠 Decontamination<br/>(FCS-GX)")]
    Decon --> Purge[("🧹 Purge Duplicates")]
    Purge --> Polishing[("✨ Polishing")]

    Scaffolding --> FinalQC[("📊 Final Validation<br/>(BUSCO, Merqury, Quast)")]
    FinalQC --> Output[("📦 Final Assembly ready for Manual curation")]

The after the assembly has been scaffolded, we recommend using complementary workflows provided by [Sanger - Tree of Life](https://pipelines.tol.sanger.ac.uk/pipelines).
