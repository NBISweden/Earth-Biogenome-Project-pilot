### GOAT genome traits estimate

[Genomes on a Tree (GOAT)](https://goat.genomehubs.org/) is a data aggregation service
that collects and provides information on the genome properties of eukaryotic species.
It also generates estimates of these properties by interpolating data from other species
within a lineage, if direct measurements are not available.

::: {.callout-warning}
While GOAT's estimates can be valuable, they should be used with caution, as their accuracy
can be compromised by poor or incomplete data for related species. When a GOAT estimate
conflicts with other sources and sufficient sequencing reads are available, it is best
practice to rely on a value calculated directly from the read data.
