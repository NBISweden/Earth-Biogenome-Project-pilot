## Introduction

This assembly report has been prepared by the National Bioinformatics Infrastructure Sweden
(NBIS) as part of the Earth Biogenome Project workflow.

Its purpose is to guide you through the analysis process, not simply summarize tool logs. We
welcome your feedback; please submit any suggestions or feature requests at
[NBIS Earth BioGenome Project - Issues](https://github.com/NBISweden/Earth-Biogenome-Project-pilot/issues).
